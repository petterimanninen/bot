	larryQuotes[10]="I have had all the disadvantages required for success. – larryQuotes Ellison";

	larryQuotes[16]="Bill Gates wants people to think he is Edison, when he’s really Rockefeller. Referring to Gates as the smartest man in America isn’t right. Wealth isn’t the same thing as intelligence. – larryQuotes Ellison";

	larryQuotes[19]="In order to grow at this pace, there will have to be a couple of acquisitions along the way. The tricky thing is to grow at this rate and maintain a 40 percent operating margin. – larryQuotes Ellison";
	larryQuotes[20]="Everyone thought the acquisition strategy was extremely risky because no one had ever done it successfully. In other words, it was innovative. – larryQuotes Ellison";
	larryQuotes[21]="You have to act and act now. – larryQuotes Ellison";
	larryQuotes[22]="I think after a certain amount, I’m going to give almost everything I have to charity. What else can you do with it? You can’t spend it, even if you try. I’ve been trying. – larryQuotes Ellison";
	larryQuotes[23]="When you are the first person whose beliefs are different from what everyone else believes, you are basically saying, ‘I’m right and everyone else is wrong.’ That’s a very unpleasant position to be in.

	larryQuotes[24]="It’s my job for Oracle, the number two software company in the world; to become the number one software company in the world.

	larryQuotes[30]="You have to take a broader view and realize this is an industry like any other – telecoms, Railroads; they went through consolidation.

And that’s why they are alone as a consolidator. – larryQuotes Ellison";

	larryQuotes[38]="I saw that we needed to grow but our top line wasn’t growing, so we had to find other ways to grow the business. We had to reshape our business and acquire share in a non conventional way. But most tech leaders don’t come out of a business background. They really have a parochial point of view. All they know are the go-go years of Silicon Valley. That’s the environment in which they were raised. – larryQuotes Ellison";
	larryQuotes[39]="When I do something, it is all about self-discovery. I want to learn and discover my own limits. – larryQuotes Ellison";
	larryQuotes[40]="There’s a wonderful saying that’s dead wrong. ‘Why did you climb the mountain? ‘I climbed the mountain because it was there.’ That’s utter nonsense.

	larryQuotes[42]="If your cash is about to run out, you have to cut your cash flow. CEOs have to make those decisions and live with them however painful they may be.

	larryQuotes[43]="I am also involved with all the acquisitions and overall strategy. Now it’s true, I don’t run operations. But I’ve never really run operations. I’ve never had the endurance to run sales. The whole idea of selling to the customer just isn’t my personality. I’m an engineer, tell me why something isn’t working or is and I am curious. – larryQuotes Ellison";

	larryQuotes[47]="I’d prefer people read about Churchill and how he wasn’t overwhelmed by Nazi Germany. Amazing; that the morale of a country rested on one person’s shoulders.

Whether it’s a biography or a movie; whether it’s fictional or true, I’m inspired by people doing great things. – larryQuotes Ellison";
	larryQuotes[48]="You have to believe in what you do in order to get what you want. – larryQuotes Ellison";
